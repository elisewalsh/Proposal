# Web Seminar Proposal

### Project 1

For the first project I would like to rework the paddleboard website that I had
developed in Web II last year. I would like to revamp the website while also adding
more information, and really develope it into a full up and running website.

The main idea was to build a website that would make the buying process of a paddleboard easier. There are so many brands and shapes on the market, even an experienced paddler may have trouble knowing what's new and upcoming in the paddling industry. I wanted to create a single website that spoke of every brand of paddleboard on the market. I want a mix of infographics as well as images and clean typography.

Apart from paddleboards I now want to incorporate leashes, fins, board bags, paddles, and car racks. That way the customer is educated with the whole package.

### Project 2

The Second web page I would like to design is based off of my seminar project. I would like the webpage to be consistent with what I've been designing. This includes focusing on texture and strong composition.

While I continue working on my thesis I will continue to add to this webpage.

I really liked the idea of having the seminar page be one page. I think this would show the consistency of design and idea. I also think that it will help keep me on track and moving forward. Lots of images and graphics and less words.

##### Semester

I would like to have these two projects going throughout the semester. I feel like one will help with where I would like to end up after school, and the other will help bring my thesis to the next level.
